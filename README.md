# Image Segmentation Code
This repository contains code for performing image segmentation using keras and pre-trained model in keras named MobileNetV2.

# Introduction
Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments to simplify the representation of an image into meaningful parts.
This repository provides an implementation of Keras for image segmentation tasks.
Keras is a high level Deep Learning library used for image processing.
